The first trend I observed from manipulating this dataset is that demographics-wise, the age group of 20-24 year olds were responsible for the highest aggregated purchase count compared to the rest of the age groups at a total of 365 purchases with a combined value of $1114.
    Interestingly enough, although the 20-24 group has the highest aggregated purchase amount, it was the 35-39 crowd that averaged to have the highest purchase amount per person (probably because older = higher disposable income ???)
It also seems like the age group of 20-24 is the primary target of this game as they make up of 33.08% of the entire player base. 
Lastly, this is not a surprise but this game has a heavier male player base with 83.6% of players being male. 
The least active age group in this game seems to be the under 10 year olds at 2.18% of the player base and the 40-and-over crowd at only 1.54% of the player base.
